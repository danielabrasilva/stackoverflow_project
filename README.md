## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2017 to better understand:

1. How important is the level of education when hiring a software developer?
2. How important is education in the developer's career?
3. Which habits are most related to career satisfaction?
4. What habits are related to the best salaries?

The full set of files related to this course are owned by Udacity, so they are not publicly available here.  


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is one notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  Each of the notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  


## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@danielabrsil/dev-who-cares-about-your-degrees-and-what-attitudes-make-you-more-satisfied-or-better-paid-df15edf885e5?source=friends_link&sk=adee1e590359534c4a1df212b4b2e081).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Stack Overflow for the data.  You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/so-survey-2017/data).  Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
